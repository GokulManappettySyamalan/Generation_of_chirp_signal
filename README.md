# Generation_of_chirp_signal

A signal that varies in frequency over time is called chirp
The frequency of the chirp signal can vary from low to high frequency (up-chirp) or from high to low frequency (low-chirp).

Chirp signals are encountered in many applications ranging from radar, sonar, spread spectrum, optical communication, image processing, doppler effect, motion of a pendulum, as gravitation waves, manifestation as frequency modulation (FM), echo location etc.

One approach to generate a chirp signal is to concatenate a series of segments of sine waves each with increasing (or decreasing) frequency in order.
This method introduces discontinuities in the chirp signal due to the mismatch in the phases of each such segments.
Modifying the equation of a sinusoid to generate a chirp signal is a better approach.
